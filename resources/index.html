            <h3>Jewish cemetery in Szydłów</h3>
            <p>
                Jewish cemetery in Szydłów near Staszów is one of the oldest cemeteries in Poland.
                The cemetery in Szydłów was set up more or less in 1317 (!), so people have been buried there for about 625 years.
                During The Second World War the cemetery was devastated.<br><br>

                There were 680 Jews living there before The Second World. This long-lasting history was broken dramatically after the outbreak of The Second World War.
                In January 1942 the Nazis set up Jewish ghetto in Szydłów. The ghetto was liquidated in October 1942.
                The Jews were transported to the extermination camp in Treblinka, where they were killed in gas chambers and their corpses were burnt.
                As the list, which is stored in the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, says, only 27 Jewish people survived the War. <br><br>

                Cemetery was desolated and there were only 12 Jewish tombstones there. There was no sign that it is the cemetery area.
                We want to renovate the Jewish cemetery in Szydłów. In 2024, we made a monument with six large marble plaques with the names of the Jews buried here.
                We found in the archives in Kielce and in Szydłów a list of those buried here from 1884 to 1941.
                In total, we have 514 names.<br><br>

                The money for this purpose come from contributions from people of good will, those who see the sense and value of this project, and from various institutions.
                We ask for your help in completing this project. <br><br>
