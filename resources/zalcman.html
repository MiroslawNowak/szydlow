        <h3>Summary of the history of the Zalcman family from Szydlów</h3>
        <p>
            It was in July 1943 in Szydłów. The Germans discovered the place where the Zalcman family
            was hiding. They were hiding in the village of Kurozwęki - 7 km from Szydłów. They were a
            father, mother, two sons, a daughter and a grandmother.
        </p>

        <p>
            They were led to the castle in Szydłów to be executed there. One of the sons, Symche
            Zalcman, took advantage of a moment of confusion on the part of the Germans and escaped
            The rest of the family was shot at the castle in Szydłów and buried there. Unfortunately,
            Symche Zalcman was killed by the Germans a few days later. The Zalcmans were exhumed in
            2018, under the supervision of a rabbinical commission, and buried in the Jewish cemetery in
            Szydłów.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, on their grave is only a modest wood gravestone. I think, that we should do
            a larger granite gravestone; and also a description of the Zalcman family history next to it.
            Then this tomb would appeal more, especially to younger generation.
